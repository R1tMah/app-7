### Resources

The project uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep things lightweight and easy to maintain. Therefore, we recommend building foundational knowledge.

  - [Codeacademy's CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
  - [Codeacademy's JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/introduction-to-javascript)

In addition, we recommend using Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor with some handy plug-ins
